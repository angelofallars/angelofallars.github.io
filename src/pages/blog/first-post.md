Greetings! First things first, I'm going to introduce myself.

I am Angelo Fallaria, and I work as a software engineer. As of writing, I am 19 years old. I swear by Neovim to edit my code. Linux is my full-time operating system. ~~I use Artix btw~~

Golang has become my favorite language due to its simplicity and speed.
I studied Spanish back in 2020, but I wouldn't say I'm still good at it.

In this blog, I want to express my thoughts and ideas about tech and software
development. I want to detail the processes I go through building software, and
elaborate how I use my tools.

I've wanted to set up a blog for a while. However, I was clueless on how to make a blog and
indecisive over which tech to use. I finally decided to use
[Astro](https://astro.build) to build this blog.

This is my first ever blog post. Thanks for reading!
